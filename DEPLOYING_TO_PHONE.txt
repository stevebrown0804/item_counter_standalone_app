Preparatory)
    On the phone (currently Pixel 8 Pro, [Android ver. TBD):
        Settings → About phone → Build number → tap 7x to enable Developer options
        Go to Settings->System->Developer Options; enabled "USB Debugging"
        Plug the phone into the computer via USB then accept the “Allow USB debugging?” prompt on the phone
        run 'flutter devices' on the computer; if the phone isn't listed, trying 'flutter doctor -v' (which will hopefully tell you what needs to be done)

To deploy a debug version of an app:
    In Android Studio:
        Top toolbar device picker → select your phone.
        Press Run ▶ (or Shift+F10).  (This installs a debug build)

To build an apk and install it on the phone:
    In a CLI, go to the project's root directory
    `flutter build apk --release`
    Make sure the phone is plugged into the computer (and possibly run `adb devices` to confirm that it's there) and that the phone's in developer mode
    `adb install [relative path of the .apk file]`
        eg. `adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
