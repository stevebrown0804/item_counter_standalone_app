TODO (DEBUG): Get undo/redo working again.

TODO (IN PROGRESS): See the backend project's TODO.txt for "things to migrate to the back-end"

TODO (NEXT UP): Move TZ alias display logic to Rust.
    "This is pure domain formatting you will absolutely want to reuse.
    The Dart change is small and low-risk."

TODO: Replace remnants of "pill tracking" legacy with "item tracking"

TODO: Remove the pill types; give a UI for entering 'items'
    When the app is started the first time, let's bring up that UI to prompt the user to enter some "stuff to count"

TODO: Look for other UI elements that can be generalized:
    App title
    LHS column header
    (anything else? TBD)

TODO: Give a way to choose other summary statistics (but probably don't implement them atm)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stuff not yet done:
1. Pills
    Insert pill? (if needed later)  <---not implemented yet; "add new pills to list" is what this means, but that's waiting for us to generalize the app/backend

5. DB export (optional)
    Provide a Rust function that returns a path to a safe copy for export.  <--not implemented, but I'm not sure we want the back-end doing this
