TODO(DONE, PRETTY SURE): Migrate any remaining functionality from the Flutter app to the rust back-end.

Per ChatGPT, here's what remains:
(Follow-up: Turns out, they were implemented in the backend; they just weren't exported in the ffi project.)

1. Pills
    List pills (id, name, display_order)
    Insert pill? (if needed later)  <---not implemented yet; "add new pills to list" is what this means, but that's waiting for us to generalize the app/backend

2. Transactions
    Insert many transactions
    Read transactions in a date range
    Delete by ID
    Delete older than N days
    Count older than N days
    Undo snapshot retrieval
    Redo insertion

3. Time zones
    List supported aliases
    Resolve alias → tz_name
    Read active alias (string)
    Set active alias

4. Settings
    Read boolean flags
    Write boolean flags

5. DB export (optional)
    Provide a Rust function that returns a path to a safe copy for export.  <--not implemented, but I'm not sure we want the back-end doing this
