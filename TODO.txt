TODO: Add 'Brand' (or 'Manufacturer') and 'Product' fields to the pills table; change the current string to 'display_name' or something.

DB migration reminder: When we start with an DB from the old 'pill_counter_flutter_app' or w/e it's called:
    Rename the time_zones table to time_zone_aliases
    Change the tz_name column in that table to iana_tz_name

    Pretty sure everything else will be put into place by the rust backend.


---------------------------------------Public use--------------------------------------------------
TODO (IN PROGRESS, AS WE FIND THEM): Replace remnants of "pill" (and related phrases) with "item", "item counter", etc.

---Minor initiatives---
TODO: Add an "Add item(s) to count" button to the settings screen
    * It'll bring up a sheet with (LHS) "Item name" and (RHS) "View order"
        * When a new item is added, use the (highest view order #) + 1 as the new view order
        * If a view order if changed to equal an existing value, let the just-changed entry take on the new value and increment all higher-valued entries (until a unused number is reached)
        * ALSO: We want a way to hide items but leave them in this list; perhaps we could allow "view order == 0" or "== -1" or something; we might also just add another column with a boolean for 'hidden;'  TBD, I guess
    * Let's also add this to the main view, when it's empty


---Major initiatives---
TODO: UI customizing
    * Let the user long-tap the (modifiable) text fields to begin editing them
        * Upon editing, store those values in the settings table in the DB
    * Also give a screen under settings for seeing/editing these values
        * Button label: "Customize UI" <---or something along these lines.  tbd.
        * Have that button bring up a sheet with (LHS) description (eg. AppBar Title) and (RHS) current value
            * Let the values on the RHS column be modified there; update the app immediately with any changes
        * Sounds like this sheet just needs a "Close" button
        * Although...that depends on the UI for editing a text field.  In-place?  Modal dialog w/ input box? tbd.

TODO: Time-zone specifying
    * Add a "Specify time zone by alias" checkbox
        * If it's checked, present a button labeled "Specify a time zone alias"
            * Pressing that button brings up a sheet of time zone aliases and an initially-empty column (except for UTC, I suppose) of tz aliases.  Let the user either tap an alias and pressed a button labeled "Enter alias" to bring up a window with an input box in which they can enter an alias (and tap an "OK" button or a "Cancel" button), or long-tap the alias field beside an alias and edit the alias in-place.
            * When the user taps in the "Time Zone" input box, it brings up a list of aliases in the DB.  (That is, it does the current behavior for selecting an alias.)
        * If the box is unchecked:
            * When the user taps into the "Time Zone" input box, it presents a complete list of tz names
            * As the user enters characters, it refines that list to names matching the substring that the user as entered.  It continues like this until the user either taps "Submit" or taps the name (which then populates the input box), then taps "Submit."
    *Add a setting with key derived from "Specify time zone by alias"; default value is false (ie. unchecked)

TODO (Once we've implemented Time-zone specifying and "Add item(s) to count"): Create a "new install" wizard that prompts the user to do those two things (or possibly import a DB or something)

TODO: UI minutiae
    Add a button to the settings sheet with label "UI minutiae"; it'll bring up a sheet of settings of various minutiae.
    eg.:
        * checkbox: auto-return to main sheet after the user clicks 'Save' on the settings sheet
            * Default value: false, I guess? *shrug*
        * checkbox: 'Show time zone'
              * Default value: True
              * When it's checked, show the "Time zone: [Alias/name]" box beneath the app title on the main view
              * When it's unchecked, hide that text
        * sliders controlling the amount of vertical paddings between rows, maybe?  *shrug*
        * (tbc as we think of things to add)


---UI stuff---
TODO: Make the Transaction Viewer sheet more compact
    Maybe move the "last # days" radio onto the first row, compress the input boxes vertically, remove space between the "All" row and the "Apply filter" button, etc.

TODO: Consolidate the 'save' buttons on the settings sheet.
    I'm thinking that we could get away with having either 1 Save button or "1 per section" or some such.  TBD.


---TBD---
TODO: Give a way to choose other summary statistics (but we probably won't implement them atm)

    ChatGPT describes the current summary statistic as:
    "In plain terms, the statistic is:
        Average per day over the last N days (including days with no logs).

    More precise description you can use in a setting name/tooltip:
        “For each pill, sum all quantities from max(today − (N−1) days, first transaction date) through today (inclusive), then divide by the number of calendar days in that range, counting days with zero intake.”"


---MAYBE---
TODO (MAYBE): Let the user long-tap & drag them to rearrange the rows of the settings sheet
